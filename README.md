# kanigawa

> Electron (or NW.js) based desktop application for setting geotags for images

## Why, there is Picasa right?

I got so fed up with its bugs and lack of support for changes in the Google Maps API, so
decided to go and solve the problem while also making myself to learn about Electron/NW.js.

## Background for the name Kanigawa

As I have done now for few of my recent projects, the names are trying to give a tribute to
ancient masters of Japanese martial arts.

## Getting started

```sh
[sudo] npm install --global kanigawa
