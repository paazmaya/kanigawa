# kanigawa (鐘川)

> Electron (or NW.js) based desktop application for setting geotags for images

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/paazmaya/kanigawa.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/paazmaya/kanigawa)

As this project/application is still being planned and investigated, both options of
[Electron](http://electron.atom.io/) and [NW.js](http://nwjs.io/) are still open.

While in the initial developing phase, in order to decide and study both of them options,
each of the two will have a specific branch for development:

* [Electron, `electron` branch](https://github.com/paazmaya/kanigawa/tree/electron)
* [NW.js, `nwjs` branch](https://github.com/paazmaya/kanigawa/tree/nwjs)

Later on `master` branch will receive updates from either of those branches and first
release will appear.

## Why, there is Picasa from Google, right?

I got so fed up with its bugs and lack of support for changes in the Google Maps API, so
decided to go and solve the problem while also making myself to learn about Electron/NW.js.

Surely there are other tools trying to achieve this functionality but they usually lack
_something_ that I deem valuable.

## Background for the project name

As I have done now for few of my recent projects, the names are trying to give a tribute to
ancient masters of Japanese martial arts. For example
[`maezato`](https://github.com/paazmaya/maezato),
[`sakugawa`](https://github.com/paazmaya/sakugawa), and
[`shigehachi`](https://github.com/paazmaya/shigehachi).

In the case of `kanigawa`, the name stands for a teacher who was known in the Ryukyu archipelago
(of which Okinawa is the biggest island) and had influence on the martial arts known as
karate and ryukyu kobujutsu today.
